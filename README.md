## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6 or higher)
- A **Firebase** account and project setup

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varun021/Epsilon.git
cd epsilon
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository, install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add your Firebase project credentials to the `.env` file in the following format:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

**Note:** Replace the placeholders (`your-api-key`, `your-auth-domain`, etc.) with your actual Firebase project credentials. You can find these details in the Firebase Console under **Project settings**.

### 4. Start the development server

Now, you‚Äôre ready to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
